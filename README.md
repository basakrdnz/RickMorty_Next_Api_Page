# rickmorty_next_w_api
I didn't use a specific Figma example on this website, but I wanted to do a colorful exercise.

-In this web page I used Rick and Morty api for data understanding and usages.

-Also I am learning Next.js so it was a valuable exercise for me to create this site for understanding the data and file structures.

-I share the vercel pages link for you to look; https://rick-morty-next-api-page.vercel.app/

-In addition to what I have done, I am exploring the motion animations for making a better looking and unique websites so even the site is not completed, in the "karakterler" part, you can see my card motions. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
